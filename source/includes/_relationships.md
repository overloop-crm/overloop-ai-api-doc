# Relationships
```shell
# EXAMPLE
GET https://api.overloop.ai/public/v1/leads?include=organization
```

> Get leads with their associated organizations

Resources returned by the API are returned in the JSON API format, which means that related entities are 
linked using a "relationship" section in the JSON payloads. 
This section only contains the links between the unique identifier of related records (in the example, Lead#29964 and Organization#1). 

In order to get access to associated information on an entity, you can use the parameter `?include=`, which will create 
a new section "included" containing the full payload of all the associated data. Notice that you can include multiple 
relationships by joining them using a comma: `GET https://api.overloop.ai/public/v1/leads?include=organization,creator`
