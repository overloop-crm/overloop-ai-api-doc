# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "https://api.overloop.com/public/v1/XXX"
  -H "Authorization: your_api_key"
```

> Make sure to replace `your_api_key` with your API key.

Overloop uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can get a new API key in your [Overloop account](https://app.overloop.com/integrations/api).

Overloop expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: your_api_key`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>your_api_key</code> with your personal API key.
